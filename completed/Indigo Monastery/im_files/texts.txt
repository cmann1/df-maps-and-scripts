[POEM 1]
A book of poems, someone has scribbled
illegible notes next to this one:

  A fleeting moment
  A brief glimmer in the dark
  Indigo light shines

Blackness without end
A brief glimmer in the dark
Indigo light shines

Cold wind from below
The indigo light wavers
A silence pervades

Dark shadows held back
Life reaches towards the light
Indigo blossoms

[R 1]
One should single-mindedly cultivate a pure mind,
set body and mind upright, and eradicate desire
and eliminate worry.
One should maintain a compassionate mind and make
focused and diligent progress.
One should not be angry or jealous or be gluttonous
or stingy.
One should not have regret halfway or have doubts.
One should be filial, have utmost sincerity, be loyal,
and be trustworthy. 

[R 2]
As to the mind itself, it is immaterial, unknowable,
andungraspable. It is nothing but a collection of
phenomena, transient and delusive by nature.

[R 3]
Between heaven and earth, the Five Paths are separate
and distinct. Good retribution, bad retribution,
good fortune, and misfortune intermingle continually
with one another.
One has to bear them alone. No one else can take
oneâ€™s place.

[APPLEMAN]
Poor guy, he's not right in the head, but we look after him
as best as we can.
He just walked into town one day, started smashing up all the
apples he could get his hands on.

We're not sure what's wrong with him, but the apples at least
seem to make him happy so we'll throw one in every now and then.
