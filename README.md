All of my [completed maps](https://atlas.dustforce.com/user/C), including all scripts, images, and audio files.
Also includes plugins and some WIP stuff.

Feel free to use the scripts in this repository in any way you want, however keep in mind that some of the audio and image files may have come from different sources on the internet and as such might be subject to their own licence restrictions.


### NOTES
- A lot of the maps depend on my [lib](https://github.com/cmann1/DustScripts) scripts.
	- Some maps may need minor tweak to get them to compile, since some of the code in `lib` might have had minor changes or been reorganised since the map was released.
- Some maps may also depend on my old common scripts library - these can be found in the `script_src/common` folder.
